# PillDetection

## Overview
PillDetection is a deep learning tool designed to identify pills based on their appearance. It employs YOLO v5 for detecting unique imprints, color, and shape, along with a CNN for detailed recognition. Users can upload pill images through a web app, which analyzes them against a database, simplifying pill identification for healthcare providers and patients.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes YOLO v5 for feature detection and a CNN for recognizing pill characteristics.
- **Web Application:** Allows users to upload images and receive identification results.
- **Database Integration:** Stores pill information for quick reference.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLO v5
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Django
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- SQL (for database management)
